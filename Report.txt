Background on the BitTorrent Protocol

    BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer Internet file sharing protocol that 
was designed by Bram Cohen in 2001. It has enjoyed widespread success 
and adoption and is currently one of the most common protocols for 
peer-to-peer transfer of large files.

    A BitTorrent downloads a file by joining a "swarm" of hosts that 
are downloading and uploading the file simultaneously. This is 
advantageous over other traditional client/server file transfer 
protocols, especially for large files that are downloaded many times,
because it more efficiently distributes the work of uploading.

    A torrent is created by creating a .torrent file, which contains
metadata that describe the file or files that make up the torrent, 
such as the url of the tracker, the creation date, the size of the 
file, the piece length, the number of pieces that make up the file,
and a 20-byte SHA1 hash for each piece of the file.

    The tracker is a host that maintains and makes available a list of
peers for the torrent. When a BitTorrent client wants to download a
file, they obtain the .torrent file, and issue a GET request to the
tracker. The tracker responds with list of peers. The client can then
begin to communicate with the peers directly to begin to download the
file.

    Peer-to-peer communication is done in BitTorrent via the following
protocol.

| YAMTORRENT OVERVIEW |
+---------------------+

An Overview of our BitTorrent Client 

	Our client can be run with the command "python3 YamTorrent.py 
<*.torrent>". It is important to use Python 3 when running the client
because some dependencies require Python 3, as does some of the syntax
used in the code written here. 

	YamTorrent first scans the .torrent file in the TorrentMetadata
for important information, such as the tracker URL (currently we only 
support HTTP), the number of pieces, and the "info" section about the file 
to be download, from which a sha1 hash is computed. YamTorrent then 
contacts the tracker in the TrackerConnection class whose URL was 
found in the torrent file with a GET request using that info hash
as one of several parameters. Also sent is a peer id that the client
wishes to be known as, the amount the client has left to download of the 
file (initially, all of it), and a flag that tells the tracker it wants
the returned information to be "compact" (this seems to be standard
practice).

	When the tracker responds to this GET requests, it is with information
about peers to which the client can potentially connect. At this point,
there is a callback to the TorrenManager's class, and the TorrentManager
can begin to initiate connections with as many of those peers as it 
choosees.

	A connection to a peer is managed by the PeerConnection class, 
which first initiates a handshake with the peer, after which (hopefully)
that peer sends along a bitfield, which allows the client to see
which pieces are available for request. The PeerConnection then listens
for an "unchoke" message from the peer, at which point it changes its 
state to reflect that it can now send messages. The TorrentManager
maintains a list of the peers it has connected to, and scans it regularly
for peer connections that are both idle (not currently requesting 
anything from a peer) and unchoked. It then searches the bitfield of that
PeerConnection for a piece to request (doing so in order of priority of
pieces). If it finds one it would like, it instructs the PeerConnection
to start downloading that piece. There is a callback for when the Peer
Connection completes downloading that piece that stores in the Torrent
Manager's bitfield that it now has the piece, and seeks to the appropriate
offset of a file to write that piece.

	The actual downloading of the piece is managed by the PeerConnection,
which sends an interested, and then sends a request for the first block.
When a block is received, it stores it and initiates the request for the 
block. It does so until all the blocks have been receives, at which point
it has a callback to the TorrentManager.

	This process continues until the whole of the file has been downloaded.
