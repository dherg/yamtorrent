Background on the BitTorrent Protocol

    BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer Internet file sharing protocol that 
was designed by Bram Cohen in 2001. It has enjoyed widespread success 
and adoption and is currently one of the most common protocols for 
peer-to-peer transfer of large files.

    A BitTorrent downloads a file by joining a "swarm" of hosts that 
are downloading and uploading the file simultaneously. This is 
advantageous over other traditional client/server file transfer 
protocols, especially for large files that are downloaded many times,
because it more efficiently distributes the work of uploading.

    A torrent is created by creating a .torrent file, which contains
metadata that describe the file or files that make up the torrent, 
such as the url of the tracker, the creation date, the size of the 
file, the piece length, the number of pieces that make up the file,
and a 20-byte SHA1 hash for each piece of the file.

    The tracker is a host that maintains and makes available a list of
peers for the torrent. When a BitTorrent client wants to download a
file, they obtain the .torrent file, and issue a GET request to the
tracker. The tracker responds with list of peers. The client can then
begin to communicate with the peers directly to begin to download the
file.

    Peer-to-peer communication is done in BitTorrent via the following
protocol.
