Background on the BitTorrent Protocol

        BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer Internet file sharing protocol 
    that was designed by Bram Cohen in 2001. It has enjoyed widespread
    success and adoption and is currently one of the most common 
    protocols for peer-to-peer transfer of large files.

        A BitTorrent downloads a file by joining a "swarm" of hosts
    that are downloading and uploading the file simultaneously. This
    is advantageous over other traditional client/server file transfer
    protocols, especially for large files that are downloaded many
    times, because it more efficiently distributes the work of 
    uploading.
